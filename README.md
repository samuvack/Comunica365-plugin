Comunica Add-in for Excel

This repository contains source code generated by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) (Word add-in, taskpane, Typescript).  
This generated code was heavily modified and extended to create the Vlaamse Overheid Comunica Excel Add-in.  
See the documentation in /docs/ for more details.

## Quick CLI reference
To quickly get started with the sources, first make sure you have the latest node.js installed.  
Check out the sources into a folder, and then open a command prompt (on Windows) in that folder.  
Now run the following commands in sequence: 
 * `npm install` → Downloads and install the node modules
 * `npm update` → Updates the node modules.
 * `npm run build` → Compiles the sources and copies the files needed for web deploy to the /dist/ folder. Also generates manifest.xml files based on settings in webpack.config.js .
 * `npm start` → Generates and installs a local TLS certificate. Starts the dev server on https://127.0.0.1:3000 . Launches desktop Word with the add-in automatically sideloaded. When running, the dev server automatically recompiles and redeploys changed sources.
 * `npm stop` → Stops the build server. Closes desktop Word.
